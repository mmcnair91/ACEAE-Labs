# Positron V3.2 Build Log - LDO Kit Batch 1
Complaints as I build:
 - LDO build guide is pretty good and easy to follow; however, I had a number of issues with the images not loading, links to photos of parts redirecting to a different part of the guide, and/or the photos not be correct for the hardware it was supposed to represent.
 - The physical parts checklist is a nice touch, but having a QR code that takes you to the build manual on LDO or Positron's website would be nice.
 - The brass standoffs for the mainboard shear off far too easily even just using the provided hex wrench.
 - If printing in pulltruded PET filament dialing in your extrusion multiplier will greatly improve part tolerances; however, for small, fine parts scaling up the parts by 1-5% can really help with getting hardware to fit properly (looking at you glass bed mounts)
